<p>Data Science is about data gathering, analysis and decision-making.<br>

Data Science is about finding patterns in data, through analysis, and make future predictions.</p>

By using Data Science, companies are able to make:

Better decisions (should we choose A or B)
Predictive analysis (what will happen next?)
Pattern discoveries (find pattern, or maybe hidden information in the data)</p>

<a name="Lifecycle">The Data science Lifecycle</a>
<p>Data Science Lifecycle revolves
 around the use of machine
 learning and different analytical 
 strategies to produce insights and 
 predictions from information in order 
 to acquire a commercial enterprise objective. 
 The complete method includes a number 
 of steps like data cleaning, preparation, modelling, 
 model evaluation, etc.
 It is a lengthy procedure and may 
 additionally take quite a few months to complete.

<p>A data scientist can use a range of different techniques, 
tools, and technologies as part of the data science process.
 Based on the problem, they pick the best combinations for faster and more accurate results.
A data scientist’s role and day-to-day work vary depending on the 
size and requirements of the organization.
 While they typically follow the data science process, the details may vary.
 In larger data science teams, a data scientist may work with other analysts, engineers,
 machine learning experts, and statisticians to ensure the data science process is 
 followed end-to-end and business goals are achieved.
